                <h3>Skyward Sword History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A goddess cannot use the Triforce, so Hylia gave up her immortality and was reincarnated as a mortal Hylian. Link makes preparations and heads to the Surface to find Zelda. As he descends, he arrives at the Sealed Grounds, where he sees a dark aura emanating from a Sealing Spike in the center of a large pit. He descends and approaches the Spike, and hears a voice telling him to strike it with a Skyward Strike. Link does so, and the sinister aura disappears. Afterwards, Link heads to the Sealed Temple. Inside, a mysterious old woman gives him a hint about Zelda's whereabouts, urging him to venture into the nearby Faron Woods to find her.</p>

                <h3>Twilight Princess History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Link, a young adult, is a ranch worker in Ordon Village in the Ordona Province of Hyrule. His mentor Rusl asks him to present a gift to the Royal Family of Hyrule in his stead. The following day, Link teaches the Village children Beth, Malo, and Talo how to use a Slingshot and a Sword. Talo spots a Monkey and proceeds to chase it into Faron Woods. Link and the rest of the children give chase. Link ventures deep into the Woods and finds Talo and the Monkey trapped in a cage surrounded by Bokoblins. He defeats the creatures and frees the pair. They head back to the Village, and Rusl tells Link that he will depart for Hyrule the following day.</p>

                <br>
                <p>At about the same time Zelda's powers awakened in the events of Breath of the Wild, a small Guardian emerges from a box in Hyrule Castle. As it sees the destruction caused by Calamity Ganon, it opens a Gate of Time to travel back before the Great Calamity. Before it jumps into the gate, a Guardian Stalker attacks it, but the small Guardian manages to make it into the gate. Unknown to it, a part of Calamity Ganon's Malice also made its way through the Gate of Time, following the small Guardian.</p>

                <h3>Ocarina of Time History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In the Kokiri Forest, all the forest children have their own guardian Fairies, bestowed upon them by the Great Deku Tree, except for one boy named Link. Link has recently been plagued by nightmares of a girl fleeing from an evil man clad in black. For as long as he can remember, Link has been ostracized by the other children and has never quite fit in. One day, as he is nearing death, the Great Deku Tree sends Navi the fairy to summon the boy to him. In order to test young Link's courage, the Great Deku Tree bids Link to venture inside his hollow and break the curse cast upon him by a "wicked man dressed in black."</p>
